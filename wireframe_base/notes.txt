Was unable to get BreweryDB API due to an Access-Control-Allow-Origin error.


Chrome 62.0.3202.75

"Failed to load https://api.brewerydb.com/v2/beers?styleId=1&key=865b6a5e9890188485b0004a1563a12a: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access."

Have used temp data to prepare and build most of the app, then will merge once I resolve the cross domain issue.
